/*
In this first experiment, we will add source code that blinks LED #0 at a rate of about 2.5 times per second using the LED module of the DSK6713 Board Support Library. 
The example also reads the state of DIP switch #3 and lights LED #3 if the switch is depressed or turns it off if the switch is not depressed.
The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate basic Board Support Library usage as well as provide a project base for your own code.  The BSL is divided into several modules, each of which has its own include file.  The file dsk6713.h must be included in every program that uses the BSL.
This example also includes  dsk6713_led.h and dsk6713_dip.h because it uses the LED and DIP modules.
