/*
C Library File IO: CCS also supports standard C library file I/O functions such as fopen( ), fclose( ), fread( ), fwrite( ), and so on. These functions not only provide the ability of operating on different file formats, but also allow users to directly use the functions on computers. Comparing with the memory load/save method introduced in the previous part, these file I/O functions are portable to other development environments. An example of C program that uses fopen( ), fclose( ), fread( ), and fwrite( ) functions is included below. Verify the working of the program in CCS.
